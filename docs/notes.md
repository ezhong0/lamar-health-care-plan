same medication for a given patient -> duplicate order

duplicate patient -> fuzzy match
- middle name / middle initial
- last name hyphen vs space

multiple orders: different medication name

npi number is a one to one relation with a provider

all should be warnings

for the purpose of this project, im just going to use llms to generate the care plans

doesnt have to be nicely formatted, only clean
- text file they can download 
- should be tabulated and easy to manage in excel

two things to export
- care plan (text)
- report of tabulated data including the care plan

p0 e2e
p1 validation
p2 tabulated data

code quality: understandable vs extendable
1st. speed, 2nd, legibility
