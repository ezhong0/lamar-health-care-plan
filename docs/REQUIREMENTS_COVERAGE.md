## Detailed Requirement Mapping

### 1. Duplicate Patient Detection (Fuzzy Matching)

**Requirement (from notes.md):**
> "Fuzzy matching algorithm to detect duplicate patients. Handle edge cases: middle name vs initial, hyphenated last names. Display as warning (not blocking)."

**Implementation:**
- File: `lib/services/duplicate-detector.ts`
- Algorithm: Jaccard similarity on character trigrams
- Weighted scoring: firstName(30%), lastName(50%), MRN(20%)
- Threshold: 0.7 (70% similarity triggers warning)

**E2E Test:**
- File: `__tests__/e2e/03-duplicate-detection.e2e.ts`
- Test: `'should warn about similar patient name (fuzzy match)'`
- Creates "Catherine Martinez" then "Katherine Martinez"
- Verifies warning modal appears
- Verifies user can proceed

**Demo Scenario:**
1. Load: "Demo: Similar Name Detection" (Catherine Bennett, MRN 900001)
2. Then load: "Demo: Katherine (triggers warning)" (Katherine Bennett, MRN 900002)
3. Result: Warning modal shows "Similar Patient Found" with similarity score

---

### 2. Duplicate Order Detection

**Requirement (from notes.md):**
> "Same medication for a given patient = duplicate order. Display as warning (not blocking). Same patient can have multiple orders with different medication names (acceptable, no warning)."

**Implementation:**
- File: `lib/services/duplicate-detector.ts`
- Logic: Checks `patientId + medicationName` combination
- Time window: Last 30 days (configurable)

**E2E Test:**
- File: `__tests__/e2e/03-duplicate-detection.e2e.ts`
- Test: `'should warn about duplicate order (same patient + medication)'`
- Creates patient with IVIG, then same patient + IVIG again
- Verifies warning appears
- Verifies user can proceed

**Demo Scenario:**
1. First, load: "Myasthenia Gravis (IVIG)" (Alice Bennet, MRN 123456, IVIG)
2. Then load: "Demo: Duplicate Order" (Alice Bennet, MRN 900003, IVIG)
3. Result: Warning shows "Duplicate Order - Patient already has order for IVIG"

---

### 3. Provider Conflict Detection

**Requirement (from notes.md):**
> "NPI Number: One-to-one relationship with a provider. Same provider should always have the same NPI number. Warn if provider name appears with different NPI numbers."

**Implementation:**
- File: `lib/services/provider-service.ts`
- Logic: When provider is upserted, checks if NPI exists with different name
- Comparison: Case-insensitive, whitespace-normalized
- Result: Returns warning if name mismatch detected

**E2E Test:**
- File: `__tests__/e2e/03-duplicate-detection.e2e.ts`
- Test: `'should warn about provider conflict (same NPI, different name)'`
- Creates patient with "Dr. Shared Provider" + NPI X
- Then creates patient with "Dr. Different Provider" + same NPI X
- Verifies warning shows both names

**Demo Scenario:**
1. First, load any example with "Dr. Sarah Chen" (NPI 1234567893)
2. Then load: "Demo: Provider Conflict" (Dr. S. Chen, same NPI 1234567893)
3. Result: Warning shows "NPI 1234567893 is registered to 'Dr. Sarah Chen'. You entered 'Dr. S. Chen'."

### 4. Care Plan Generation

**Requirement (from projectdescription.md):**
> "Once the data is entered and patient records are entered into a text field, then call an LLM to generate a care plan as a text file they can download and upload into their system."

**Implementation:**
- File: `lib/services/care-plan-service.ts`
- LLM: Claude Haiku 4.5 (fast, cost-effective)
- Timeout: 25 seconds (fail-fast design)
- NO retry (deliberate UX choice - fail fast, user can manually retry)
- Input sanitization: Prevents prompt injection

**E2E Test:**
- File: `__tests__/e2e/04-care-plan-generation.e2e.ts`
- Mocks: Uses API mocking to avoid AI costs during tests
- Tests: Generation, error handling, timeout scenarios

**Demo Scenario:**
- All patient examples can generate care plans
- Best examples for demo:
  - "Simple Case (Omalizumab)" - fast, clean output
  - "Myasthenia Gravis (IVIG)" - realistic clinical scenario
  - "Complex Multi-System (Rituximab)" - demonstrates handling complex medical data

---

### 5. Excel Export for Pharma Reporting

**Requirement (from notes.md):**
> "Data Report Export: Format: Tabulated data (Excel-compatible). Content: All input data + generated care plans. Purpose: Reporting to pharmaceutical companies. Should be easy to manage in Excel."

**Implementation:**
- File: `lib/services/export-service.ts`
- Format: CSV (Excel-compatible)
- Includes: All patient data + order data + care plan count
- Columns: Patient name, MRN, provider name, NPI, medication, diagnosis, care plan count

**E2E Test:**
- File: `__tests__/e2e/05-export.e2e.ts`
- Tests CSV generation, format validation, data accuracy

**Demo Scenario:**
- Not demonstrated via preloaded examples (export is a reporting feature)
- Demo by creating several patients, then clicking "Export to CSV" button

## Demo Workflow for Interview

### Workflow 1: Happy Path
1. Load "Simple Case (Omalizumab)" → Submit
2. Generate care plan → Download
3. Show patient list → Export CSV
4. **Demonstrates:** P0 features working end-to-end

### Workflow 2: Duplicate Detection
1. Load "Demo: Similar Name Detection" (Catherine Bennett) → Submit
2. Load "Demo: Katherine (triggers warning)" → Submit
3. See warning modal → Proceed anyway
4. **Demonstrates:** P1 fuzzy matching with warning (not blocking)

### Workflow 3: Provider Conflict
1. Load "Myasthenia Gravis (IVIG)" (Dr. Sarah Chen, NPI 1234567893) → Submit
2. Load "Demo: Provider Conflict" (Dr. S. Chen, same NPI) → Submit
3. See provider mismatch warning → Proceed anyway
4. **Demonstrates:** P1 provider conflict detection (critical for pharma reporting)

### Workflow 4: Validation Errors (Blocking)
1. Manual entry: Enter patient with invalid NPI (e.g., "1234567890" - fails Luhn)
2. See client-side error: "Invalid NPI checksum"
3. Cannot submit until fixed
4. **Demonstrates:** P0 validation preventing bad data

## Fixed Issues in Examples

### Issue 1: Duplicate NPI Between Examples (Fixed)
**Before:**
- `rheumatoidArthritisExample`: Dr. Michael Chang, NPI `1245319599`
- `complexMultiSystemExample`: Dr. David Kim, NPI `1245319599` ← SAME NPI!

**After:**
- `rheumatoidArthritisExample`: Dr. Michael Chang, NPI `1679576722` (kept)
- `complexMultiSystemExample`: Dr. David Kim, NPI `1518060555` (changed)

**Why it mattered:** Would trigger provider conflict warning unintentionally when loading both examples.

## Interview Talking Points

### "How did you prioritize features?"
> "I had a clarification call with the founder to confirm P0/P1/P2. P0 was end-to-end patient creation + care plan generation. P1 was duplicate detection warnings. P2 was Excel export. I implemented all of them because they're all critical to the business - duplicate detection prevents fraud, and pharma exports are a major revenue source."

### "How did you test duplicate detection?"
> "Three levels: (1) Unit tests for the Jaccard similarity algorithm with edge cases, (2) E2E tests creating actual duplicate scenarios in the browser, (3) Preloaded demo examples so stakeholders can see warnings in action without manual setup."

### "Why warnings instead of blocking?"
> "Per the founder's guidance: medical assistants need discretion. Same patient CAN legitimately have multiple orders. Similar names might be typos OR different people. Provider name variations might be intentional (Dr. Smith vs Dr. John Smith). We show high-severity warnings with full context, but let the medical assistant make the final call."

### "What's the most complex requirement?"
> "Fuzzy patient matching. Had to handle: (1) Name typos (Catherine vs Katherine), (2) Middle names vs initials, (3) Hyphenated last names, (4) Performance (can't check all patients). I used Jaccard similarity on trigrams with weighted scoring, checking last 100 patients. Documented migration path to PostgreSQL pg_trgm for scale."

## Remaining Known Issues

### Test Failures (Non-Critical)
- 28 failing tests (PatientCard + error-handler)
- Root cause: Interface mismatches after refactoring
- Impact: Low (all business logic tests pass)
- Status: Should fix before interview for polish

### Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
- Real-time collaboration (multiple users)
- Audit log for all changes
- Role-based access control
- Streaming care plan generation (token-by-token)
- Background job queue for care plans
