About Lamar Health

Lamar Health is building modern infrastructure for healthcare delivery â€” helping care teams, clinics, and patients connect seamlessly through intelligent software. Our mission is to bring speed, clarity, and coordination to a space thatâ€™s too often fragmented and slow.

We work with leading healthcare organizations to reimagine how technology supports care delivery â€” from data integration to patient experience. Every deployment matters because it directly affects how real people access care.

About the Role
As a Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) at Lamar Health, youâ€™ll bridge the gap between our core platform and the real-world needs of our customers â€” health systems, clinics, and care teams. Youâ€™ll work hand-in-hand with users to understand their workflows, design solutions that streamline operations, and ensure that our technology drives measurable impact in patient outcomes and care efficiency.

Youâ€™ll write production-quality code, collaborate with our product and engineering teams, and bring new ideas from the field into the heart of our roadmap.

What Youâ€™ll Do
Work directly with healthcare customers to understand their clinical, operational, and data challenges.
Design and implement integrations, data pipelines, and lightweight applications on top of Lamarâ€™s platform.
Build internal tools and deployment automation that make future implementations faster and more reliable.
Collaborate with product and engineering teams to influence the roadmap based on real-world customer needs.
Prototype rapidly, deploy confidently, and iterate based on feedback from users in the field.
Translate technical complexity into clear, actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders.
Who You Are
You have 0â€“3 years of experience building and shipping software in production (Python, TypeScript, or similar).
Youâ€™re excited about the intersection of technology, healthcare, and product thinking.
You love talking to users, uncovering pain points, and crafting pragmatic technical solutions.
Youâ€™re comfortable in ambiguity â€” prioritizing impact over perfection.
You value empathy and communication as much as technical skill.
You want to see your work directly improve healthcare delivery and patient experience.
Bonus Points
Projects youâ€™ve worked on and can share
Prior experience in a customer-facing engineering, consulting, or startup role.
Comfort working in regulated or privacy-sensitive environments (HIPAA, SOC2).
Why Youâ€™ll Love Working at Lamar Health
Impact: Your work will touch real clinics, doctors, and patients â€” every deployment matters.
Ownership: Youâ€™ll shape how our platform is used in the field and help define our product direction.
Growth: Work cross-functionally with engineers, clinicians, and product leaders solving complex, meaningful problems.
Mission: Join a team genuinely driven to make healthcare more human, efficient, and connected.
