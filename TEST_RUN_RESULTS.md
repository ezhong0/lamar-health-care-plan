# Playwright Test Run Results

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Total Tests**: 32
**Passing**: 13 (40%)
**Failing**: 19 (60%)

## ✅ Passing Tests (13)

### Patient Creation (2/3)
- ✅ should navigate to patients list and see newly created patient
- ✅ should show all form fields with correct labels

### Form Validation (5/6)
- ✅ should show validation errors for empty required fields
- ✅ should show error for invalid MRN (not 6 digits)
- ✅ should show error for invalid NPI (not 10 digits)
- ✅ should show error for invalid NPI checksum (Luhn algorithm)
- ✅ should clear errors when fields are corrected

### Care Plan Generation (2/5)
- ✅ should display existing care plan when returning to patient page
- ✅ should not allow generating care plan twice

### Error Scenarios (3/9)
- ✅ should validate required fields on blur (client-side)
- ✅ should sanitize XSS attempts in form inputs
- ✅ should handle missing API routes gracefully

## ❌ Failing Tests (19)

### Patient Creation (1/3)
- ❌ should create a new patient with valid data
  - **Issue**: Patient name not found after creation (warnings page handling)

### Form Validation (1/6)
- ❌ should show error for invalid ICD-10 format
  - **Issue**: Error message text doesn't match expectation

### Duplicate Detection (5/5 - ALL FAILING)
- ❌ should block duplicate MRN (blocking error)
- ❌ should warn about similar patient name (fuzzy match)
- ❌ should warn about duplicate order (same patient + medication)
- ❌ should warn about provider conflict (same NPI, different name)
- ❌ should be able to cancel from warning page
  - **Common Issue**: Warning page elements not being found

### Care Plan Generation (3/5)
- ❌ should generate care plan for a patient
- ❌ should download care plan as markdown file
- ❌ should handle care plan generation error gracefully
  - **Issue**: Care plan generation timing/visibility issues

### Export Functionality (4/4 - ALL FAILING)
- ❌ should export patient data via API endpoint
- ❌ should export data with correct CSV format and headers
- ❌ should include patient data in export
- ❌ should export multiple patients if they exist
  - **Issue**: CSV content assertions failing

### Error Scenarios (6/9)
- ❌ should handle API error gracefully during patient creation
- ❌ should handle network timeout gracefully
- ❌ should prevent double submission with rapid clicks
- ❌ should handle browser back button after successful submission
- ❌ should handle invalid patient ID in URL
- ❌ should handle long clinical notes without crashing
  - **Various Issues**: Mock interference, navigation issues, error message expectations

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. **Warnings Page Handling** (MAJOR)
- Many tests expect immediate navigation to patient detail
- Instead, a warnings page appears for duplicate detection
- The helper `createPatientViaUI` now handles this, but some tests still fail

### 2. **ICD-10 Validation Message**
- Need to check actual error message text from validator

### 3. **Export API Response**
- Tests expecting specific CSV structure
- Need to verify what the actual API returns

### 4. **Care Plan Mocking**
- Mock might not be intercepting correctly
- Or care plan generation timing issues

### 5. **Error Scenario Mocks**
- Some mocks interfere with actual functionality
- Need more selective mocking

## Next Steps

1. Fix ICD-10 error message expectation
2. Debug why first patient creation test still fails
3. Fix duplicate detection tests (warnings page)
4. Fix export tests (verify actual CSV output)
5. Fix care plan generation tests
6. Fix remaining error scenario tests

## Summary

**Improvements Made**:
- Fixed helper to handle warnings page ("Proceed Anyway")
- Fixed form validation test (Zod instead of HTML5)
- Fixed NPI error message expectation
- Removed unnecessary export API mocking

**Still TODO**:
- 19 tests need fixes
- Main issues are around warnings page, export format, and care plan generation
